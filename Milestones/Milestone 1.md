## Milestone 1

For this week, we completed our Milestone #1, which consisted of creating the Pieces class as well as getting the board set up for the initial play. For next week will be attempting to add movement and kinging to the pieces. Additionally, we may try to recode the project in Java rather than Processing for the final project.
