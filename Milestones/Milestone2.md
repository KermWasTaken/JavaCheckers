## Milestone 2

For this week we met together on zoom and discussed a different strategy for moving forward with the project. Originally the plan was to use processing to do the graphical component of the project, this will be adjusted in order to meet the requirements of the project. A 2D graphical interface library will be used to accomplish this. With the switch to entirely Java we set up a framework of classes and methods necessary to accomplish the goal. These will be filled in and tested as the project progresses. The structure of the project which was outlined in the project plan will remain the same, we just have to adjust to Java.
