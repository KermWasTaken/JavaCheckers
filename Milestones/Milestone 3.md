For this week the group focused on restrategizing how to approach the problem again and started from there. For one we are no longer using processing, we are only using swing as our main method of graphical interfacing. The code up till now is capable of moving the pieces. The next function which the group will work to accomplish is the jumping feature of the pieces. The group also put the presentation together with the skeletal structure of the code. This included the objectives to be accomplished as well as bonus features the group is potentially going to incorporate.
