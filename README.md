# EE552 - Final Project: Java Checkers Project Plan

## Milestone #1: Creation of checker piece class and board Set-up

For our first milestone, we are planning on implementing a java class for the checkers pieces as well as creating and filling the board with new starting pieces whenever a new game is started.

Some of the initials fields that we are going to add to our checker pieces include:
* Team/color
* isKing
* Position

and some methods that the checkers pieces will have include:
* createKing
* Move
* Remove

Here is our vision of what the program will automatically do when a new game begins:
